    <p>My name is Jacqueline Demers, i was born and raised in Orlando, FL. I orginally began my career in graphic arts but shortly after moved over to hospitality mangement. I love music! I love finding new music to listen to that will fit my mood! I listen to just about everything and switch up what i listen to depending on how i feel. I'm a book worm at heart! I love reading and prefer books over TV and movies. I also have a HUGE problem speeding...which im working on. I love being outdoors and try to spend by extra time paddle boarding, canoeing or going to the springs with friends! </p>
