<!--Short Bio-->
    <p>My name is Jaqueline Demers, I was born and raised in Orlando, FL. I Originally got into the graphic arts field but shortly after switched over to hospitality management. I'm a bookworm at heart and prefer books over TV and movies and love reading! I enjoy being outdoors as much as possible. Any free time I have I usually spend paddle boarding, canoeing or going to the Springs with friends. I recently really got into fitness and have dramatically changed my diet and workout program. I'm supper excited to see where this new journey I have began takes me! </p>
